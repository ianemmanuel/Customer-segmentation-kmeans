The project aims to segment customers of a mall based on their age, annual income, and spending score using the K-means clustering algorithm. The dataset contains information on the age, annual income, and spending score of customers visiting the mall.

K-means clustering algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning technique used for grouping data points into different clusters based on their similarities. The algorithm works by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid.

In this project, the K-means algorithm will be applied to the customer dataset to group customers into different clusters based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The optimal number of clusters will be determined using the elbow method.
